# DRG-Mod-Manager
Local Mod Manager for Deep Rock Galactic

## How it works:
  - Download executable from [here](https://github.com/ThomasJeffersonSucka/DRG-Mod-Manager/raw/main/Executables/DRG_Mod_Manager3.exe)
  - When opened, it will auto-detect your local pak repository, and will auto-pull all paks from the [DRG-Mods Site](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/blob/main/README.md)
  - Use search functions to filter local/github mods
  - Download the ones you want to add to your local repository
  - Enable/disable/remove as needed
